<p>The public interest has been of late years
so strongly manifested in favour of the poets
of the seventeenth century, that little apology
appears necessary for the republication of the
following Poems. It would, however, be
equally vain and foolish in the editor to claim
for the author a place among the higher class
of poets, or to exalt his due praise by depreciating
the merits of his contemporaries.—Claiming
only for Cæsar what to Cæsar is due,
it may without arrogance be presumed that
these pages will not be found inferior to the
poems of others which have been fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
republished, or familiarised to the generality
of readers through the popular medium of
selections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p>The author of the following poems (an
account of whose life may be considered as a
necessary appendage to these pages) is said
to have descended from the antient family of
the Corbets in Shropshire. It were too laborious
and pedantic in a work of this nature to
trace his pedigree, but I should be pleased to
find any proofs of their attachment to him:
yet as the bishop did not usually “conceal
his love,” I suspect he received no mark of
their regard, at least till his elevation conferred
rather than received obligation by acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Richard Corbet, successively bishop of Oxford
and Norwich, was born at the village of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
Ewell in Surrey, in the year 1582: he was
the only son of Bennet, or Benedicta, and
Vincent Corbet, who, from causes which I
have not discovered, assumed the name of
Poynter. His father, a man of some eminence
for his skill in gardening, and who is
celebrated by Ben Jonson in an elegy<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> alike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
honourable to the subject, the poet, and the
friend, for his many amiable virtues, resided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
at Whitton, a hamlet in the parish of Twickenham,
where the poet passed his declining
days. Under the will of his father<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he inherited
sundry freehold lands and tenements
lying in St. Augustine’s parish, Watling-street,
London, and five hundred pounds in
money, which was directed to be paid him by
Bennet, the father’s wife and sole executrix,
upon his attaining the age of twenty-five
years. After receiving the rudiments of education
at Westminster School, he entered in
Lent term 1597-8 at Broadgate Hall, and the
year following was admitted a student of
Christ-Church College, Oxford. In 1605 he
proceeded Master of Arts, and became celebrated
as a wit and a poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>The following early specimen of his humour
is preserved in a collection of “Mery Passages
and Jeastes,” Harl. MS. No. 6395: “Ben
Jonson was at a tavern, and in comes bishop
Corbet (but not so then) into the next room.
Ben Jonson calls for a quart of <i>raw</i> wine,
and gives it to the tapster. ‘Sirrah!’ says
he, ‘carry this to the gentleman in the next
chamber, and tell him I sacrifice my service
to him.’ The fellow did, and in those terms.
‘Friend!’ says bishop Corbet, ‘I thank him
for his love; but pr’ythee tell him from me
that he is mistaken, for sacrifices are always
burnt.’”</p>

<p>In 1612, upon the death of the amiable
and accomplished Henry Prince of Wales,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The expectancy and rose of the fair state,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the theme of many a verse; the University,
overwhelmed with grief, more especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
as he had been a student of Magdalen
College under the tutorage of Mr. John
Wilkinson, (“afterwards the unworthy president
of that house,”) and desirous of testifying
their respect for his memory, deputed
Corbet, then one of the proctors, to pronounce
a funeral oration; “who,” to use the words of
Antony Wood, “very oratorically speeched
it in St. Maries church, before a numerous
auditory<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.” On the 13th of March in the
following year he performed a similar ceremony
in the Divinity School on the interment
of sir Thomas Bodley, the munificent founder
of the library known by his name.</p>

<p>Amid the religious dissensions at this period,
encouraged and increased by James’s
suspected inclination to popery, it was scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
possible to avoid giving offence to the supporters
of the various doctrinal opinions which
in this confusion of faiths divided the people.
At the head of the Church was Dr. George
Abbott, a bigoted and captious Puritan: opposed
to this disciple of Calvin was Laud,
then growing into fame, who boldly supported
the opinions of Arminius. With the latter
Corbet coincided: but the undisguised publication
of his faith had nearly proved fatal to
his future prospects; for, “preaching the Passion
sermon at Christ-Church, (1613,) he insisted
on the article of Christ’s descending into
hell, and therein grated upon Calvin’s manifest
perverting of the true sense and meaning of
it: for which, says Heylyn, he was so rattled
up by the Repetitioner, (Dr. Robert Abbott,
brother of the archbishop,) that if he had not
been a man of a very great courage, it might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
have made him afraid of staying in the University.
This, it was generally conceived,
was not done without the archbishop’s setting
on; but the best was, adds Heylyn, that none
sunk under the burthen of these oppressions,
if (like the camomile) they did not rise the
higher by it<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.”</p>

<p>When James, in 1605<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, visited Oxford in
his summer progress, the wits of the sister
University vented their raillery at the entertainment
given to the royal visitor<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Cambridge,
which had long solicited the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
honour, was in the year 1614-5 indulged
with his presence. Many students from Oxford
witnessed the ceremonial of his reception;
and the local histories of the two Universities
at that period, are replete with pasquinades
and ballads sufficiently descriptive
of their mutual animosities. An eye-witness
declares, “Though I endured a great deal of
penance by the way for this little pleasure,
yet I would not have missed it, for that I see
thereby the partiality of both sides—the Cambridge
men pleasing and applauding themselves
in all, and the Oxford men as fast condemning
and detracting all that was done;
wherein yet I commended Corbet’s modesty,
whilst he was there; who being seriously
dealt withal by some friends to say what he
thought, answered, that he had left his malice
and judgment at home, and came there only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
to commend<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.” Notwithstanding this conciliatory
declaration, the opportunity of retorting
upon the first assailants was too tempting
to Corbet’s wit to be slighted; and immediately
upon his return he composed the ballad,
<a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>, “To the tune of Bonny Nell.”—This
humorous narrative excited several replies;
the most curious of which was the one,
in Latin and English, (at <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>,) written,
perhaps, by sir Thomas Lake, afterwards
secretary of state, who performed the part of
Trico in the Cambridge play of Ignoramus,
and who had a ring bequeathed him by the
author, Ruggles<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Corbet appears, says Headley<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
been of that poetical party who, by inviting
Ben Jonson to come to Oxford, rescued him
from the arms of a sister University, who has
long treated the Muses with indignity, and
turned a hostile and disheartening eye on
those who have added most celebrity to her
name<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>We do not find that Ben expressed any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
regret at the change of his situation: companions
whose minds and pursuits were similar
to his own, are not always to be found in the
gross atmosphere of the muddy Cam, though
easily met with on the more genial banks of
the Isis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Largior hic campos æther.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1616 he was recommended by the Convocation
as a proper person to be elected to
the college which Dr. Matthew Surtclyve,
dean of Exeter, had lately erected at Chelsea,
for maintaining polemical Divines to be employed
in opposing the doctrines of Papists
and Sectaries. Whether he obtained his election
I have not learned: nor is it of much moment;
for the establishment, as might be naturally
foreseen from the circumstances of the
times, soon declined from its original purpose<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span></p>

<p>Being now in a situation to indulge his inclinations,
he in 1618 made a trip to France,
from whence he wrote an “epistle to sir
Thomas Aylesbury,” in which he gently
laughs at his friend’s astronomical fondness;
and composed a metrical description of his
journey, from which we may conclude that
he returned less disgusted with his native
country, and less enamoured of the manners
and habits of his new acquaintance, than is
usual with the modern visitors of our transmarine
neighbours.</p>

<p>He was now in holy orders; and, in
the language of Antony Wood, “became
a quaint preacher, and therefore much followed
by ingenious men.” None of Corbet’s
sermons are, I believe, in existence: the modesty
that withheld his poems from the press,
during his life, prevented his adding to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
multitude of devotional discourses with which
the country was at this period infested<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
Those who are at all acquainted with the
ecclesiastical oratory of James’s reign, will be
at no loss to comprehend “honest Antony’s”
description; but to those who are not, it may
be sufficient to observe, that, of its peculiar excellencies
and demerits, the sermons of bishop
King, his contemporary, (which have been republished)
are a complete “picture in little.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span></p>

<p>About this time he appears, from the following
characteristic letter<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, to have solicited
promotion at the hands of Villiers duke of
Buckingham:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="indent">“May it please your Grace</p>

<p>“To consider my two great losses this
weeke: one in respect of his Majesty to whom
I was to preach; the other in respect of my
patron whom I was to visit. Yf this bee
not the way to repare the later of my losses,
I feare I am in danger to bee utterly undon.
To press too neere a greate man is a meanness;
to be put by, and to stand too far off,
is the way to be forgotten: so Ecclesiasticus.
In which mediocrity, could I hitt it, would
I live and dy, my lord. I would neather
press neere, nor stand far off; choosing rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
the name of an ill courtier than a sawsy
scholer.</p>

<p>“I am your Grace’s most humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Richard Corbet</span>.”</p>

<p class="smaller hanging">Christ’s Church,<br />
this 26 Feb.</p>

</div>

<p>“Heer are newes, my noble lord, about us,
that, in the point of alledgeance now in hand,
all the Papists are exceeding orthodox; the
only recusants are the Puritans.”</p>

<p>Of the nature of the object thus supplicated,
my inquiries have not informed me: he was
now dean of Christ-Church, vicar of Cassington
near Woodstock in Oxfordshire, and
prebendary of Bedminster secunda in the
church of Sarum: it was, perhaps, the appointment
of chaplain to the King, which he
received about this time; and if to this period
may be assigned the gratulatory poem
at <a href="#Page_83">page 83</a>, it should seem that Buckingham
was not solicited in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span></p>

<p>In 1619 he sustained a great loss in the
decease of his amiable father, at a very advanced
age; whose praise he has celebrated
in the most honourable terms, and whose
death he has lamented in the language of
rational and tender regret.</p>

<p>When James paid a second visit to Oxford
in 1621, Corbet, in his office of chaplain,
preached before the monarch<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, who had presented
him (as it seems) with a token of his
favour, such as flattered in no small degree
the vanity of the dean. The progress of the
court and its followers is thus ludicrously
described in an anonymous poem transcribed
from Antony Wood’s papers<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in Ashmole’s
Museum:</p>

<p>With poetical badinage of this complexion
the wits of the University of Oxford, with
Corbet at their head, “who loved this boy’s
play to the last,” abounded. While many
of the pasquinades are lost, many, however,
are still preserved among Ashmole’s papers:
on most occasions Corbet was at least a match
for his opponents, but this misfortune of the
ring became a standing jest against him: it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
is alluded to at <a href="#Page_233">page 233</a>; and it is demanded
in another poem<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, if</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the evening of the same Sunday, the
students of Christ-Church, willing to show
their respect for the royal visitor, obtained
leave to present a play before the King; and
they chose, with no great display of taste,
Barten Holyday’s ΤΕΧΝΟΓΑΜΙΑ, or “The
Marriage of the Arts,” which had been acted
in Christ-Church hall the 13th of February,
1617. The play was so little relished, that
the king was with difficulty persuaded to sit
till its conclusion: the “enactors” became
subjects of ridicule to the University; and,
though Corbet and King rhymed in their
favour, the laugh went against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span></p>

<p>Indeed the Oxonians were not more unfortunate
in their theatrical representations on
this than on former occasions. Upon the
visit of James, in 1605, two out of three dramatic
exhibitions, prepared at great expense
and performed by the students, were, according
to the testimony of an eye-witness, received
with tædium, and rewarded with unconcealed
disgust<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span></p>

<p>The writers of the poet’s life are silent as
to the period of his marriage; and if I am
unable to communicate any information on
this point, it will not, I trust, be attributed
to any parsimony of research, or indifference
as to fact when conjecture can be substituted.
Those who have made literary biography
their study, know that it is frequently much
easier to write many pages than to ascertain
a date, and hence but too frequently ingenuity
supplies the place of labour and inquiry: in
the present instance, every record that suggested
a probability of containing any memorial
relative to the family of the subject of
this biography has been inspected personally;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
but before the passing of the Marriage Act,
nothing is more uncertain than the probable
place of the celebration of that ceremony<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>In this dearth of fact as to dates, I shall
presume to suppose he married about 1625
Alice the only daughter of his fellow-collegian
Dr. Leonard Hutton, a man of some eminence
in his day as a divine and an antiquary, and
whose character is thus drawn by Antony
Wood with a felicity that rarely accompanies
his pencil: “His younger years were beautified
with all kind of polite learning, his
middle with ingenuity and judgment, and
his reverend years with great wisdom in government,
having been often subdean of his
college.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span></p>

<p>This union of wit and beauty was not
looked upon with indifference, nor was their
epithalamium unsung, or the string touched
by the hand of an unskilful master:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The offspring of this marriage were a
daughter named Alice, and a son born the
10th of November, 1627, towards whom the
beautiful poem at <a href="#Page_150">page 150</a> is an undecaying
monument of paternal affection.</p>

<p>Of these descendants of the bishop I lament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
that I have discovered so little: if this volume
should be fortunate enough to excite attention
to its author, the loss may at some future period
be supplied: they were both living when
their grandmother, Anne Hutton, made her
will in 1642, and the son administered to the
testament in 1648.</p>

<p>In 1628 Corbet suffered a severe privation
in the loss of his patron Villiers duke of Buckingham,
assassinated by Felton on the 23d
of August, who, whatever were his political
crimes, was, like his amiable and indulgent
master, a liberal promoter of literature and
science, and to his death an encourager of
Corbet’s studies. If, however, this event
checked his hopes of promotion for a season,
it did not leave him without a patron; for,
upon the translation of Hewson to the see of
Durham, (to make way for Dr. Duppa to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
dean of that church,) he was elected bishop
of Oxford the 30th of July, was consecrated
at Lambeth the 19th of October, and installed
the 3d of November, 1629; “though,” in
the opinion of Wood, “in some respects unworthy
of such an office<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.”</p>

<p>Warned by the many petulant remarks on
the poetical character scattered throughout
the account of Oxford writers, one is little
surprised at this churlish remark on the part
of honest Antony, who seems to have considered
all poetry as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... inopes rerum, nugæque canoræ,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and its indulgence inconsistent with the clerical
profession. Corbet was certainly no
“precisian,” and perhaps his only fault was
possessing a species of talent to which Antony
had no pretension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span></p>

<p>The bishopric of Oxford he held but a
short time, being translated to a more active
see, that of Norwich, in the month of April
1632; when a dispute arose as to his right
of claim to the glebe sown previous to his
vacating the vicarage: the opinion of the
attorney-general, (Noy,) which is preserved
in the Harleian collection of manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
was in his favour, <i>in as much as the translation
was not his own act merely</i>.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March, 1633, he preached
before the king at Newmarket<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span></p>

<p>Scarcely was he seated in the episcopal
chair of Norwich when Abbott died, and
Laud, who had long exercised the authority
of metropolitan, was two days afterwards
(August 6th, 1633) preferred to the see of
Canterbury. Having now “no rival near
his throne,” in the warmth of his zeal he immediately
applied himself to reform abuses
and exact a conformity to the established
church, the discipline of which had exceedingly
relaxed during the ascendancy of his
calvinistic predecessor. For this purpose
Laud issued certain orders and instructions
to the several bishops, insisting upon a strict
examination into the state of religion and its
ceremonies in their several dioceses; the result
of which was transmitted to that prelate, and
by him laid before the King. These representations,
many of which are curious, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
printed in the nineteenth volume of Rymer’s
Fœdera. On his part, Corbet certified that
he had suppressed the lectures of some factious
men, and particularly that he had suspended
one Bridges, curate of St. George’s
parish, Norwich; but, upon submission, he
had taken off his suspension. Among others,
he had heard complaint of Mr. Ward<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, of
Ipswich, for words in some sermons of his,
for which he was called before the High Commission.</p>

<p>From the following conciliating epistle I
conclude that Ward submitted, and was restored
to his cure:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“Salutem in Christo.</p>

<p class="indent">“My worthie friend,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span></p>

<p>The zeal of Laud did not rest here: he set
sedulously about suppressing the Dutch and
Walloon congregations, of which there were
several in London, Norwich, and other places.</p>

<p>It will be perhaps necessary to observe,
that the Dutch, the Walloons, and the French,
who had continued to refuge in England from
the reign of Edward the Sixth, had obtained
many privileges from former kings, and among
others, the liberty of celebrating divine service
after their own, that is, the presbyterian,
manner. Their congregations were scattered
over the kingdom; and at this period there
was at Norwich one of the Dutch, and one
of the Walloons, the latter of which carried
on an extensive manufacture of woollen cloths,
for the vending of which, they in 1564 obtained
a lease of the chapel of St. Mary the
Less, which they fitted up as a hall or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
market-place for that purpose. Where they performed
divine service before the year 1619
I know not, but in that year Samuel Harsnet
licensed the Walloon congregation to use
during his pleasure the Bishop’s chapel, or
chapel of the Virgin Mary<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. This indulgence
was continued during the government
of his successor, Francis White. But the
intolerance of Laud would be content with
nothing short of conformity; Corbet consequently
prepared to dislodge them by the
following characteristic letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“To the minister and elders of the French
church, in Norwich, these:</p>

<p class="center">“Salutem in Christo.</p>

<p>“You have promised me from time to time
to restore my stolen bell, and to glaze my lettice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>
windows. After three yeeres consultation
(bysides other pollution) I see nothing mended.
Your discipline, I know, care not much for
a consecrated place, and anye other roome in
Norwiche that hath but bredth and length
may serve your turne as well as the chappel:
wherefore I say unto you, without a miracle,
<i>Lazare, prodi foras!</i> Depart, and hire some
other place for your irregular meetings: you
shall have time to provide for yourselves betwixte
this and Whitsontide. And that you
may not think I mean to deale with you as
Felix dyd with St. Paul, that is, make you
afraid, to get money, I shall keepe my word
with you, which you did not with me, and
as neer as I can be like you in nothinge.</p>

<p>“Written by me, Richard Norwich, with
myne own hand, Dec. 26, anno 1634.”</p>

</div>

<p>The congregation remonstrated to Laud, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span>
the February following, against the commands
of their poetical pastor; but the archbishop
insisted that his instructions should stand, and
obedience be yielded to his injunctions<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>While, under the direction of the Archbishop,
he was thus severe with the heterodox,
he was equally zealous in supporting the establishment
of which he was a dignitary:
exertions were now making by the King, the
Clergy, and indeed all orders of people, for
the restoring Saint Paul’s cathedral, which had
remained in ruins since its second destruction
by fire, early in Elizabeth’s reign. In 1631<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span>
a special commission was issued by the King,
for the purpose of collecting money, to be
applied to this purpose. The subscription
went on tardily till Laud contributed a hundred
pounds, to be renewed annually, and
“Corbet bishop of Norwich (then almoner
to the king) giving four hundred pounds,
multitudes of others, says Stowe, for eleven
years together brought in their monies very
plentifully<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.” Nor did his liberality stop
here: Wood says<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that in addition to this
contribution, which at the time we speak of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span>
was an enormous bounty, he gave money to
many needy ministers, thereby to excite the
donations of their wealthier brethren; and
he pronounced the following admonitory, persuasive
and satirical address<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to the clergy
of his diocese:</p>

<p>“Saint Paul’s church! One word in the
behalf of Saint Paul; he hath spoken many
in ours: he hath raised our inward temples.
Let us help to requite him in his outward.
We admire commonly those things which are
oldest and greatest: old monuments, and
high buildings, do affect us above measure:
and what is the reason? Because what is
oldest cometh nearest God for antiquity: and
what is greatest, comes nearest his works for
spaciousness and magnitude: so that in honouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span>
these we honour God, whom old and
great do seem to imitate. Should I commend
Paul’s to you for the age, it were worth your
thought and admiration. A thousand years,
though it should fall now, were a pretty
climacterical. See the bigness, and your eye
never yet beheld such a goodly object. It’s
worth the reparation, though it were but for
a land mark; but, beloved, it is a church,
and consecrated to God. From Charles to
Ethelbert she hath been the joy of princes.
It was once dedicated to Diana (at least some
part of it); but the idolatry lasted not long.
And see a mystery in the change: Saint Paul
confuting twice the idol, there in person,
where the cry was, ‘Great is Diana of the
Ephesians!’ and here: by proxy. Paul installed,
where Diana is thrust out. It did
magnify the creation, it was taken out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span>
darkness: light is not the clearer for it, but
stronger and more wonderful: and it doth
beautify this church, because it was taken
from pollution. The stones are not the more
durable, but the happier for it. It is worthy
the standing for the age, the time since it
was built, and for the structure, so stately an
edifice is it: it is worthy to stand for a memorial
of it from which it is redeemed, but
chiefly for his house that dwells therein. We
are bound to do it, for the service sake that is
done in it. Are we not beholden to it, every
man, either to the body, or the choir: for a
walk or a warbling note: for a prayer or a thorough-path?
Some way or other, there is a
topick may make room for your benevolence.</p>

<p>“It hath twice suffered Martyrdom: and
both by fire, in the time of Henry the Sixth
and the third of Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span></p>

<p>“Saint Paul complained of Stoning twice;
his church of firing: stoning she wants, indeed,
and a good stoning would repair her.</p>

<p>“Saint Faith holds her up, I confess. Oh
that works were sainted to keep her upright!
The first way of building churches was by
ways of benevolence; but then there needed
no petition: men came on so fast that they
were commanded to be kept back, but repairing
now, needs petition. Benevolence was a
fire once had need to be quenched: it is a
spark, now and needs blowing on it: blow it
hard, <i>and put it out</i>. Some petitions there
are, for pulling down of such an isle, or
changing lead for thack: so far from reparation,
that our suit is to demolish. If to
deny this be persecution, if to repair churches
be innovation, I’ll be of that religion too.</p>

<p>“I remember a tale in Henry Steevens, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span>
his Apology for Herodotus, or in some of the
Colloquies of Erasmus, which would have us
believe that times were so depraved in popery,
that all œconomical discipline was lost by
observing the œcumenical; that if an ingenious
person would ask his father’s blessing, he
must get a dispensation and have a licence
from the bishop.</p>

<p>“Believe me when I match this tale with
another. Since Christmas I was sued to (and
I have it under the hands of the minister and
the whole parish) that I would give way to
the adorning of the church within and without,
to build a stone wall about the church-yard
which till now had but a hedge. I took
it for a flout at first, but it proved a suit
indeed; they durst not mend a fault of forty
years, without a licence. Churchwardens,
though they say it not, yet I doubt me most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span>
of them think it, that foul spirits in the
Gospel said, ‘O thou Bishop or Chancellor,
what! art thou come to torment us before the
time, that all is come down to the ground?’
The truth went out once in this phrase:
‘Zelus domûs tuæ exedit ossa mea,’ but now
vice versa, it is, ‘Zelus meus exedit domum
tuam.’ I hope I gall none here.</p>

<p>“Should Christ say that to us now which he
said once to the Jews, ‘Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will build it up again:’
we would quickly know his meaning not to be
the material temple. Three years can scarce
promoove three foot.</p>

<p>“I am verily persuaded, were it not for the
pulpit and the pews, (I do not now mean the
altar and the font for the two sacraments, but
for the pulpit and the stools as you call them;)
many churches had been down that stand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>
Stately pews are now become tabernacles,
with rings and curtains to them. There wants
nothing but beds to hear the word of God
on; we have casements, locks and keys, and
cushions; I had almost said, bolsters and
pillows: and for those we love the church.
I will not guess what is done within them,
who sits, stands, or lies asleep, at prayers,
communion, &amp;c., but this I dare say, they
are either to hide some vice or to proclaim
one; to hide disorder, or proclaim pride.</p>

<p>“In all other contributions justice precedes
charity. For the King, or for poor, as you
are rated you must give and pay. It is not so
in benevolence. Here Charity rates herself;
her gift is arbitrary, and her law is the conscience.
He that stays till I persuade him,
gives not all his own money: I give half that
have procured it. He that comes persuaded
gives his own; but takes off more than he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>
brought, God paying use for nothing. But
now comes your turn to speak, or God in
you by your hands: for so he useth to speak
many times by the hands of Moses and Aaron,
and by the hands of Esay and Ezekiel, and
by the hands of you his minor prophets.
Now prosper, O Lord! the works of these
hands! O prosper Thou our handy work!
Amen.”</p>

<p>He was not fated, however, to witness the
elevation of the temple in favour of which he
was thus active and benevolent; indeed he
was then consuming with lingering disorders.
“Corbet, bishop of Norwich,” says the garrulous
correspondent of lord Strafford, “is
dying; the best poet of all the bishops in
England. He hath incurable diseases upon
him, and hath been said to be dead<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.” This
was written on the 30th of July, 1635, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span>
he had rested from his labours two days preceding.
He was buried in the cathedral
church of his diocese, where a large stone
was laid over his remains, to which a brass
plate was affixed, bearing his arms and the
following inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Ricardus Corbet, Theologiæ Doctor,<br />
Ecclesiæ Cathedralis Christi Oxoniensis<br />
Primum Alumnus, deinde Decanus, exinde<br />
Episcopus, illinc huc translatus, et<br />
Hinc in cœlum Jul. 28. An. 1635.</p>

</div>

<p>By his will “he commits and commends
the nurture and maintenance of his son and
daughter to the faythful and loving care of
his mother-in-law Anne Hutton;” from which,
and the total silence as to his wife, I conclude
he outlived her—and with a legacy of
one thousand pounds to his daughter Alice,
to be paid at her attaining the age of seventeen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[l]</span>
or upon her marriage, he enjoins her
not to marry without the consent of her grandmother.
By the further provisions of his
testament, his son was to be joined with Anne
Hutton in the administration upon his attaining
the age of seventeen; and in case of the
decease of both, the whole was to devolve
upon his daughter Alice.</p>

<p>Such was the end of this learned and ingenious
prelate and poet, of whose works I have
undertaken the revision, and in collecting the
scattered memorials for whose biography,</p>

<p>His person, if we may rely upon a fine portrait
of him in the hall of Christ-Church, Oxford,
was dignified, and his frame above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[li]</span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Aubrey says, he had heard that “he had
an admirable grave and venerable aspect.”</p>

<p>In no record of his life is there the slightest
trace of malevolence or tyranny: “he was,”
says Fullers<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, “of a courteous carriage, and no
destructive nature to any who offended him,
counting himself plentifully repaired with a
jest upon him.” Benevolent, generous and
spirited in his public character; sincere, amiable,
and affectionate in private life; correct,
eloquent, and ingenious as a poet; he appears
to have deserved and enjoyed through life the
patronage and friendship of the great, and
the applause and estimation of the good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lii"></a>[lii]</span></p>

<p>Apology is not necessary for his writings,
or it might be urged that they were not intended
for publication by their author. “His
merits are disclosed,” and, at the distance of
near a century and a half, are now again
submitted to the censure of the public.</p>

<p>His panegyric is liberal without grossness,
and complimentary without servility: his satires
on the Puritans, a pestilent race which
Corbet fortunately did not live to see ascendant,
and which soon after his decease sunk
literature and the arts in “the Serbonian
bog” of ignorance and fanaticism, evince his
skill in severe and ludicrous reproof; and the
addresses to his son and his parents, while
they are proofs of his filial and parental regard,
bear testimony to his command over
the finer feelings. But the predominant faculty
of his mind was wit, which he employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span>
with most success when directed ironically:
of this the address “to the Ghost of Wisdome,”
and “the Distracted Puritane,” are
memorable examples. Indeed he was unable
to overcome his talent for humour, even when
circumstance and character concurred to repress
its indulgence. Of this propensity the
following anecdotes, copied <i>verbatim</i> from
Aubrey’s MSS. in Mus. Ashmole<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, are curious
proofs, and may not improperly close
this account of a character which they tend
forcibly to illustrate.</p>

<p>“After he was doctor of divinity, he sang
ballads at the Crosse at Abingdon; on a market-day
he and some of his comrades were at
the taverne by the Crosse, (which, by the
way, was then the finest of England; I remember
it when I was a freshman; it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span>
admirable curious Gothicque architecture,
and fine figures in the nitches; ’twas one
of those built by king ... for his queen.)
The ballad-singer complayned he had no
custome—he could not put off his ballads.
The jolly Doctor puts off his gowne, and puts
on the ballad-singer’s leathern jacket, and
being a handsome man, and a rare full voice,
he presently vended a great many, and had
a great audience.</p>

<p>“After the death of Dr. Goodwin, he was
made deane of Christ-Church. He had a
good interest with great men, as you may
finde in his poems; and that with the then
great favourite the duke of Bucks, his excellent
wit ever ’twas of recommendation to him.
I have forgot the story; but at the same time
Dr. Fell thought to have carried it, Dr.
Corbet put a pretty trick on him to let him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lv"></a>[lv]</span>
take a journey to London for it, when he had
alreadie the graunt of it.</p>

<p>“His conversation was extreme pleasant.
Dr. Stubbins was one of his cronies; he was
a jolly fat doctor, and a very good housekeeper.
As Dr. Corbet and he were riding
in Lob-lane in wet weather, (’tis an extraordinary
deepe dirty lane,) the coach fell,
and Corbet said, that Dr. S. was up to the
elbows in mud, and he was up to the
elbows in Stubbins.</p>

<p>“A. D. 1628, he was made bishop of Oxford;
and I have heard that he had an admirable
grave and venerable aspect.</p>

<p>“One time as he was confirming, the country
people pressing in to see the ceremonie,
said he, ‘Beare off there! or I’ll confirm ye
with my staffe.’—Another time, being to lay
his hand on the head of a man very bald, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvi"></a>[lvi]</span>
turns to his chaplaine, and said, ‘Some dust,
Lushington,’ to keepe his hand from slipping.—There
was a man with a great venerable
beard; said the bishop, ‘You, behind
the beard!’</p>

<p>“His chaplaine, Dr. Lushington, was a very
learned and ingenious man, and they loved
one another. The Bishop would sometimes
take the key of the wine-cellar, and he and
his chaplaine would go and lock themselves
in and be merry; then first he layes down
his episcopal hood, ‘There layes the doctor;’
then he putts off his gowne, ‘There
layes the bishop;’ then ’twas, ‘Here’s to
thee, Corbet;’—‘Here’s to thee, Lushington.’”</p>

<p>One word on the subject of the former editions;
which bear dates 1647, 1648, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvii"></a>[lvii]</span>
1672. The first and last impressions correspond
in their contents, and the publisher
of the latter has also copied, for the most
part, the errors of his predecessor, which are
so numerous as to render the poems not unfrequently
unintelligible. I must observe,
however, from the information of Mr. Park,
that many copies of the first edition conclude
at page 53. The additions extend the volume
to 85 pages. The only impression with
any pretension to accuracy is that of 1648,
which, from its internal evidence, I suspect
was published under the eye of the Bishop’s
family; I have therefore retained the Preface.
It contains only twenty-four poems.</p>

<p>An edition bearing the date of 1663 is cited
in Willis’s Cathedrals; but, it is believed,
through mistake.</p>

<p>I heere offer to view a collection of certaine
peices of poetry, which have <i>flowne</i> from hand to
hand, these many yeares, in <i>private</i> papers, but
were never <i>fixed</i> for the <i>publique</i> eie of the worlde
to looke upon, till now<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. If that witt which
runnes in every veyne of them seeme somewhat
<i>out of fashion</i>, because tis neither <i>amorous</i> nor
<i>obscene</i>, thou must remember that the author,
although scarse a <i>Divine</i> when many of them were
written, had not only so <i>masculine</i> but even so
<i>modest</i> a witt also, that he would lett nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxiv"></a>[lxiv]</span>
fall from his pen but what he himselfe might
owne, and never blush, when he was a <i>bishop</i>;
little imagining the age would ever come, when
his calling should prove more out of fashion than
his witt could. As concerning any thing else
to be added in commendation of the author, I
shall never thinke of it; for as for those men
who did <i>knowe him</i>, or ever <i>heard of him</i>, they
need none of <i>my good opinion</i>: and as for those
who <i>knew him not</i>, and never so much as <i>heard
of him</i>, I am sure he needs none of <i>theirs</i>.</p>

<p>In the following tribute to the memory of a fellow-collegian,
and predecessor in the deanery of
Christ Church, it will not be too much to conjecture
that Corbet was urged by gratitude for kindness
experienced while the latter was young. The
“Elegie” was evidently written immediately upon
the interment of its subject, as towards its conclusion
he complains that no tomb was raised
over his remains; a complaint which was soon
after obviated, when a fair monument was erected,
bearing the following inscription, which contains
all that is necessary to be told here of the
circumstances of his life and character:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LADY_ARABELLA_STUART">LADY ARABELLA STUART.</h2>

</div>

<p>The circumstances of the life of this accomplished
and persecuted lady,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From kings descended, and to kings allied,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are familiar to every reader of biographical history.
In Lodge’s Illustrations of British History
are some letters which convey an exalted idea of
her mental abilities; and the editor has proved, in
opposition to the assertion of the authors of the
Biographia Britannica, that she was far from deficient
in personal beauty.</p>

<p>She was the only child of Charles Stuart, fifth
earl of Lennox, (uncle to James the First, and
great-grandson to Henry VII.) by Elizabeth,
daughter of sir William Cavendish, of Hardwick;
was born about the year 1578, and brought up
in privacy under the care of her grandmother,
the old countess of Lennox, who had for many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
years resided in England. Her double relation to
royalty was equally obnoxious to the jealousy of
Elizabeth and the timidity of James, and they
secretly dreaded the supposed danger of her leaving
a legitimate offspring. The former, therefore,
prevented her from marrying Esme Stuart, her
kinsman, and heir to the titles and estates of her
family, and afterwards imprisoned her for listening
to some overtures from the son of the earl of
Northumberland: the latter, by obliging her to
reject many splendid offers of marriage, unwarily
encouraged the hopes of inferior pretenders.
Thus circumscribed, she renewed a childish connection
with William Seymour, grandson to the
earl of Hertford, which was discovered in 1609;
when both parties were summoned to appear before
the privy council, and received a severe reprimand.
This mode of proceeding produced the
very consequence which James meant to avoid;
for the lady, sensible that her reputation had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
been wounded by this inquiry, was in a manner
forced into a marriage; which becoming publicly
known in the course of the next spring, she was
committed to close custody in the house of sir
Thomas Parry, at Lambeth, and Mr. Seymour to
the Tower. In this state of separation, however,
they concerted means for an escape, which both
effected on the same day, June 3, 1611; and Mr.
Seymour got safely to Flanders: but the poor
lady was re-taken in Calais road, and imprisoned
in the Tower; where the sense of these undeserved
oppressions operating too severely on her
high spirit, she became a lunatic, and languished
in that wretched state, augmented by the horrors
of a prison, till her death on the 27th Sept. 1615.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Upon the death of the promising Henry (Nov. 6,
1612), a prince, according to Arthur Wilson<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>,
as eminent in nobleness as in blood, and who fell
not without suspicion of foul play, the poets his
cotemporaries, whom he liberally patronised,
poured forth by reams their tributary verses.</p>

<p>Corbet, as it has been before observed, pronounced
his funeral oration at Oxford.</p>

<p>Nor was this all: while his bones were perishing
and his flesh was rottenness, Dr. Daniel Price,
his chaplain during his life, continued to commemorate
his dissolution by preaching an anniversary
sermon. Neither the practice nor its execution
was agreeable to Corbet, who, after a triennial
repetition, thus attacked the anniversarist.</p>

Armada in the reign of Elizabeth, a nobleman
of high estimation during greater part of the

</div>

<p>The lord Mordaunt to whom this poem is addressed
was John fifth baron Mordaunt of Turvey,
in the county of Bedford, who was afterwards
(in 1628) created earl of Peterborough by king
Charles the First. He married Elizabeth, daughter
and heir of William baron Howard of Effingham,
(son and heir apparent of Charles earl of
Nottingham,) by Anne his wife, daughter and
heir of John baron St. John of Bletsoe. He
was brought up in the Roman Catholic religion,
but converted to that of the established
church by a disputation at which he was present
between a Jesuit and the celebrated Dr. Usher,
(afterwards) bishop of Armagh. In 1642 he was
general of the ordnance, and colonel of a regiment
of foot in the army, raised for the service of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the Parliament, commanded by the earl of Essex,
and died the same year.</p>

<p>In order to understand the following poem, it
will be necessary to remember, that James, in the
year 1617, paid a visit to his native country,
whither the lord Mordaunt accompanied him;
and the ceremony of installing the knights of the
garter was consequently deferred from St. George’s
day to that of Holyrood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIR_THOMAS_AYLESBURY">SIR THOMAS AYLESBURY,</h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent">A Londoner born, was second son of William
Aylesbury by Anne his wife, daughter of John
Poole, esq., and from Westminster School removed
to Christ-Church, Oxford, in 1598, where he became
a fellow-student with Corbet, and where, on
the 9th of June 1605, they took the degree of
master of arts together.</p>

<p>Aylesbury, after he had left Oxford, became
secretary to Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham,
lord high admiral of England, and in 1618, when
the latter resigned his office, was continued in
the same employment under Howard’s successor,
George Villiers, then marquis, and afterwards
duke of Buckingham. Under the patronage of
Villiers he was appointed one of the masters of the
requests, and on the 19th of April 1627 created<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
a baronet, and soon afterwards obtained the office
of master of the mint. He retained his places
until the breaking out of the civil wars in 1642,
and faithfully adhering to the cause of Charles
the First, retired with his family, in 1649, after
the execution of that unfortunate monarch, to
Antwerp in Brabant, and continued there until
1652, when he removed to Breda, where he died
in 1657, aged 81, and was buried in the great
church.</p>

<p>He was “a learned man, and as great a lover
and encourager of learning and learned men, especially
of mathematicians, (he being one himself)
as any man in his time.”</p>

<p>He had a son, William, who was a man of learning,
and tutor to the two sons of his father’s patron,
Villiers, but died issueless in Jamaica in the
service of Cromwell in the same year with his
father: and a daughter, Frances, (sole heir of
her father and brother) who, in 1634, became the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
wife of Edward Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon,
and was grandmother to queen Mary the
Second, and to queen Anne.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in noticing
what relates to sir Thomas Aylesbury, since bishop
Corbet’s advancement at court followed,
though it trode close upon the heels of, that of
Aylesbury, which leads me to presume that the
latter was in some degree Corbet’s patron as well
as friend and companion.</p>

<p>John Hammon, M.A., to whom the following
“Exhortation” is addressed, was instituted to the
rectory of Bibbesford and chapel of Bewdley in
Worcestershire the 2d of March 1614, on the presentation
of sir William Cook. The new zeal
with which he was inspired arose most probably
from the intrusion of the “Book of Sports,” by
James, in 1618<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, in which the king’s pleasure is
declared, “that, after the end of divine service,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
our good people be not disturbed, letted or discouraged
from any lawfull recreation; such as
dauncing, either men or women; archerie for men,
leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmlesse
recreation; nor from having of May games, Witson
ales, and Morris dances, and the <i>setting up of
Maypoles and other sports therein used</i>; and that
women shall have leave to carry rushes to the
church for the decoring of it, according to their
old custome.”</p>

ascertained, assumed the name of Poynter, was
one of those by whose experience and information
sir Hugh Platt, at a period when the horticultural

enabled to publish his “Garden Of Eden.” The
beautiful “Epitaph” of Ben Jonson, and the following
“Elegy,” are high testimonials of his amiable
and virtuous disposition.</p>

mother, whose name was Rose, was buried at
Twickenham, September the 13th, 1611, and the
register of the same parish proves that her son
pursued her path the 29th April, 1619.</p>

<p>Among other legacies, he bequeathed to the
poor of Twickenham forty shillings, to be paid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
immediately after his decease; and four loads of
charcoal, to be distributed at the discretion of the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DUKE_OF_BUCKINGHAM">THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM.</h2>

</div>

<p>Of the romantic expedition to Spain of “Baby
Charles and Stennie” an account is given by Clarendon,
and a more minute narrative by Arthur
Wilson in his Life of James. The voyage was
conducted with great secrecy, and very few attendants:
but it is worthy remark, that Archee
“the princes fool-man” was one of the party.
Howell, who was at Madrid at the time, says,
“Our cousin Archy hath more privilege than any,
for he often goes with his fool’s-coat where the
<i>Infanta</i> is with her Meninas and ladies of honour,
and keeps a blowing and blustering amongst them,
and flurts out what he list.” One of his “flurts”
at the Spaniards is related in the same page<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>The poem, as far as it describes the various rumours
during the absence of the parties, a period
of great consternation, is curious: the report of
Buckingham’s “difference with the Cond’ Olivares”
rests upon better authority than the then
opinion of the poet.</p>

<p>They left the court Feb. 17th, and returned to
England the 5th Oct. 1623.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARL_OF_DORSET">RICHARD,<br />
THE THIRD EARL OF DORSET,</h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Is described by his wife, the celebrated lady Anne
Clifford, daughter of George earl of Cumberland,
in the manuscript memoirs of her life, as a man
“in his own nature of a just mind, of a sweet disposition,
and very valiant in his own person. He
had a great advantage in his breeding, by the
wisdom and devotion of his grandfather, Thomas
Sackville, earl of Dorset, and lord high treasurer
of England, who was then held one of the wisest
of that time; by which means he was so good
a scholar in all manner of learning, that, in his
youth, when he was at the university, there was
none of the young nobility then students there
that excelled him. He was also a good patriot
to his country, and generally well beloved in it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
much esteemed in all the parliaments that sat in
his time, and so great a lover of scholars and soldiers,
as that, with an excessive bounty towards
them, or indeed any of worth that were in distress,
he did much diminish his estate; and also
with excessive prodigality in house-keeping, and
other noble ways at court, as tilting, masking, and
the like; prince Henry being then alive, who was
much addicted to those noble exercises, and of
whom he was much beloved.” He died at the
age of 35, March 28th, 1624.</p>

<p>I should be very unwilling to deprive Corbet
of the praise due to a poem of so much intrinsic
merit; but as the following epitaph is printed
among the poems of his contemporary, King, bishop
of Chichester, and again attributed to the
latter in MS. Ashmole, A 35, Corbet’s claim to
the composition of it is rendered very disputable.</p>

<p class="noindent">The only son of the poet, was born (if the authority
of a manuscript in the Harleian collection
may be relied upon, in which this pathetic address
appears,) on the 10th of November, 1627.
From the following injunction in the bishop’s
will<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, it seems he was educated at one of the
universities: “I commit and commend the nurture
and maintenance of my sonne and daughter
unto the faythfull and loving care of my mother-in-law,
declaring my intent, &amp;c., that my sonne
be placed at Oxford or Cambridge, where I require
him, upon my blessing, to apply himself to
his booke studiously and industriously.”</p>

<p>In 1648 he administered to the will<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of his
grandmother Anne Hutton; and of the further
circumstances of his life I am ignorant.</p>

<p>Seems a sort of imitation of Horace’s Brundusian
journey. Davenant has “a journey into Worcestershire”
(page 215. fol. edit.) in a similar vein,
says Headley. If the popularity of this poem
may be estimated by the frequency of manuscript
copies in the public libraries, we may conclude
it was valued very highly, as the transcripts of it
are very numerous.</p>

<p>Misled by one of these, I considered this poem,
the longest and most celebrated of bishop Corbet’s
productions, to have been written in 1625: subsequent
examination has induced me to place the
date of its composition considerably earlier: the
reasons on which this opinion is grounded, will be
detailed in the following analysis of the Tour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Our author commences his journey from Oxford
in a company consisting of four persons,
two of whom then were, and two of whom wished
to be, doctors: but there is nothing in the course
of the tour to show us which of the classes he belonged
to, unless we are to suppose, from the
shortness of cash which discovers itself before the
termination of his adventures, that he was rather
one of those who had wealth in expectancy than
in possession.</p>

<p>They set off on the 10th of August, and, long
as the days are about that period, had a good chance
of sharpening their appetites by their first half-day’s
ride, thirty miles before dinner, when they sat down
to dine with Dr. Christopher Middleton, at his
rectory of Ashton on the Wall in Northamptonshire,
about eight miles north of Banbury; where
we learn that their entertainment was better than
the looks of their host, whom they left in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
evening, and rode to Flore, about twelve miles
north-east, and took up their lodgings for the night.</p>

<p>At Flore they were entertained by a country
surgeon, or (in the vulgar phrase) bone-setter,
the tenant of Dr. Leonard Hutton, the rector of
Flore and dean of Christ-Church, who fed them
upon venison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5</div>

<p>The third morning they set off for Daventry,
about five miles. Here it happened to be the
market- and lecture-day: and after having washed
down the dust which their throats had acquired
in the ride, one of them was summoned by the
serjeant at mace to deliver the lecture; for which
they were all rewarded with thanks and wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16</div>

<div class="sidenote">13</div>

<p>The fourth morning they rode to Lutterworth
in Leicestershire, about sixteen miles. This was
once the benefice of Wickliffe, the father of English
reformers; and here the tourist very properly
remarks on the double injustice done to that venerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
character, first by the Papists in burning
his body, and afterwards by the Puritans in destroying
the sacred memorial of the interment of
his ashes. At Lutterworth they were met by a
parson, who though well-beneficed was better-mannered,
and was their guide to his dwelling
within a mile of Leicester. A note on the older
editions of Corbet calls this gentleman the Parson
of Heathcot: but there is no place of the name of
Heathcot in that neighbourhood; and as, by
comparison with other parts of the tour in which
miles are mentioned, one mile will be invariably
found to signify one and a half at the least; and
as less than two reputed miles is accounted only
one mile in the distance of places, I presume it
was Ayleston, and not Heathcot, where the party
rested, and were regaled with stale beer. At length
they arrived at Leicester, thirteen miles north
of Lutterworth, where, passing over six steeples
and two hospitals, (“one hospital twice told,”)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
which he refers to the eye of Camden, he censures
the ignorance of the alms-man, who, notwithstanding
it was written on the walls that Henry
of Grisemont laid the foundation, told them it
was John of Gaunt. Henry Plantagenet, earl of
Lancaster, was the first founder of the hospital
in the Newark at Leicester in the year 1330,
which was considerably enlarged and improved,
and converted into a college by his son Henry,
the good duke of Lancaster, in 1355; but there
is a more general sense in which the word Founder
is used, namely, that in which it is extended to
all those who inherit, either by descent or by purchase,
the patronage under the original founder.
And in this sense it may be applied to John of
Gaunt, the second duke of Lancaster, who married
his near kinswoman the heiress of the former
duke, and perfected both in buildings and endowments
what the others had commenced. The
other hospital alluded to, is that founded by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
William Wigston, merchant of the Staple, about
1520.</p>

<p>The tourist next observes on the extortion of
the innkeeper, who, reckoning by the number of
his guests rather than the goodness of his provision,
charged them seven shillings and sixpence
for bread and beer; but, after a kindly caution to
the publican to forbear such cozenage upon Divines
in future, lest they should be suspected of
drinking as freely as he charges them, turns from
a subject so unworthy of his Pegasus in disgust,
and inquires if this be not the burial-place of
Richard the Third; and, finding that there is no
memorial for him, moralizes upon the neglected
state in which he lies, as the eventual fate of all
greatness: then from Richard proceeds to Wolsey,
who was also buried at Leicester, and produces
similar reflections; and from Wolsey, to William
the ostler of the inn, who outdoes the company
in years as well as drink, and calls them to horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
as imperiously as if he had a warrant from the
earl of Nottingham.</p>

<p>The earl of Nottingham here glanced at was
Charles lord Howard of Effingham, lord high admiral
of England under queen Elizabeth and king
James the First. He died in 1624.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>From Leicester to Nottingham (twenty-five
miles) the travellers pass without noticing any
thing on their way, until approaching the latter
place they cross the Trent, pray to St. Andrew as
they ride up hill, into the town, and observe that
the people burrow, like conies, in caverns, from
whence the smoke ascends at the feet of the woman
who stands on the surface watching, down the
chimney, the cooking of her dinner. The part of
the town at which they enter is described as the
Rocky Parish, higher than the rest; and the church
of St. Mary, as embracing her Baby in her arms.
From hence they proceed to the Castle, which is
described as a ruin, with two statues of giants at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
gates, whom the tourist severely censures for their
negligence in permitting their charge to come to
ruin, and reproaches them with the fidelity of the
giants at Guildhall and Holmeby, who had carefully
kept the buildings committed to their charge
when the founders were dead. The poet might
still compliment the giants at Guildhall; but of
Holmeby (Holdenby House, Northamptonshire,
built by queen Elizabeth’s lord chancellor, sir
Christopher Hatton,) not one stone remains upon
another: nay, the very memory of the giants
might have perished but for the Iter Boreale.</p>

<p>The travellers then go to dinner at the Bull’s
Head, where the archbishop of York had been
before them, and where their discontent with bed
and diet was answered by a reference to the satisfaction
which <i>he</i> had received; and where the
aged landlord, formerly an ostler, is noticed as a
rare example to those who have an itch for gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20</div>

<p>Their next stage was to Newark, (about twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
miles, or, according to the reckoning of the poet,
twelve), which is spoken of as no journey, but only
a walk; and the banks of the Trent as so fertile
and beautiful, that the English river takes away the
palm from the celebrated Meander. The pleasure
of this part of their journey was not diminished
by their reception at Newark, where they met
with a friend, out of respect to whom the town
united as a family to give the travellers a hearty
welcome; and even the landlord of one inn did
not repine that they had passed his house to go
to another, and the landlord of the inn where
they rested was more solicitous of their approbation
than his own profit. The very beggars
rather prayed for their friend than begged of his
guests, and the Puritans were willing to “let the
organs play,” if the visitors would tarry.</p>

<p>From Newark they saw Bever (Belvoir) and
Lincoln, and would fain have gone there but for
the limitation on their purse and horses. At three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
o’clock they set off, with twenty (thirty) miles to
ride, (probably to Melton Mowbray); and having
neither guide, nor horse of speed, after losing
their way, two hours after sun-set blundered upon
a village, from whence they obtained a guide to
Loughborough. From thence they set off next
morning for Bosworth, (eighteen miles,) but in
their way thither are lost in Charley Forest, and
ask their way from the travellers they meet about
the coal-mines at Coalorton, without receiving an
answer; when William, their attendant, seeing a
man approach, imagines himself to be in Fairyland.
But the party are agreeably surprised by
finding him one of the keepers of the forest, who
conducts them within view of Bosworth.</p>

<p>At Bosworth they meet with far better treatment
than the appearance of the place had promised;
and, when their host there, who was their
guide the next morning, brought them near to
the field on which the battle of Bosworth was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
fought, are greatly amused by his romantic description
of the battle. The guide seems to leave
them at Nuneaton in Warwickshire, six miles
(about nine) from Bosworth; from whence they
proceed to Coventry, nine miles; and from
thence, having scarcely had time to dine, depart
for Kenilworth, five miles, where they are offended
by the indecency of an aged parson, who
attended the servant of the lord Leicester, it is
presumed, to show them the Castle. The Castle
of Kenilworth was once the splendid residence
of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, one of the
favourites of queen Elizabeth, and on his death,
in 1588, passed to his son, Robert Dudley, who
used the title of earl of Leicester,—but by a decree
of the Star-Chamber was declared to be illegitimate,
and from disgust at that sentence retired
into Italy, under a license for three years; and
being summoned by the privy-council, at the instigation
of his enemies, to return into England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and refusing to obey the summons, the Castle of
Kenilworth was, for his contumacy, seized by the
Crown under the statute of Fugitives; and Henry
prince of Wales, in the year 1611, purchased a
release of the inheritance of it from sir Robert
Dudley, who was to have the constableship of the
Castle, under prince Henry, for life. It does not
appear, however, that sir Robert Dudley resided
at Kenilworth afterwards: he probably had little
regard for a place of which he had been compelled
to relinquish the inheritance. This may account
for the neglected state in which it was found by
our poet and his companions.</p>

<p>From Kenilworth they proceed to Warwick,
three (five) miles, noticing in their way the Cave
of the celebrated hero of English romance, Guy
earl of Warwick, as also his Pillar: and at Warwick
we have a humorous description of the landlady
of the inn. From the inn they proceed to
the Castle, where they are received by “the lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of all this frame, the honourable Chancellor,”
whose politeness and elegance of manners receive
favourable notice. Sir Fulk Greville obtained a
grant of Warwick Castle from king James the
First, in the second year of his reign, (1604,)
and was about the same time appointed chancellor
of the exchequer; and resigned his office of chancellor,
on being elevated to the peerage by the
title of lord Brooke, 19th of January, 1620-21.
It may be observed, that the author of the Iter
notices him as an honourable chancellor, not as
noble lord; which he certainly would have done if
the Iter had not been of an earlier date than 1621.</p>

<p>With sir Fulk Greville they found a prelate of
the church, an archdeacon, whom a note in the
old editions calls archdeacon Burton. This, I
presume, was Samuel Burton, A. M. of Christ-Church,
Oxford, who paid first-fruits for the archdeaconry
of Gloucester, in the cathedral of Gloucester,
the 9th of May, 1607, and died the 14th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of June, 1634, and was buried at Dry-Drayton
in Gloucestershire. He is described as sufficiently
corpulent to deserve the displeasure of the Puritans,
whom our author never loses an opportunity
of lashing.</p>

<p>From Warwick they arrive at Flore, (about
twenty-one miles,) having been able to make both
ends (of their purse) meet; and, after staying
there four days, arrive at Banbury on St. Bartholomew’s
day, (24th of August,) desirous to see
what sport the saint would produce there. At
this place (where they rested at the sign of the
Altar-Stone) the tourist finds the altar converted
into an inn, and, judging by the sign, lodged in
a chapel, but, by the wine, in a bankrupt tavern;
and yet, by the coffins converted into horse-troughs,
a church. But though you may judge,
by what is found at the inn, that the church is
full of monuments, you will be disappointed; for
there was not an inscription in the church except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the names of the last year’s churchwardens,—with
buckets and cobwebs hanging, instead of painted
saints, in the windows. In short, the town seems
to have been a strange collection of sectaries differing
from each other.</p>

<p>From hence he returns to Oxford, twenty-two
miles, with as little coin in his purse as sir Walter
Raleigh brought from his unsuccessful expedition
to Guiana in 1618; between which period and
1621 it is clear the poem was written.</p>

</div>

<p>Was rector of Settrington in Yorkshire, and was
presented to the archdeaconry of Ely by Elizabeth
the 27th of February 1559-60. In bishop
Cox’s Certificatorium (MS. Bennet Col. Lib.) he
is returned to the archbishop as “a priest and B. D.
usually residing upon his living of Wilberton,
appropriated to the archdeaconry, was qualified
for preaching, and licensed thereunto by the
Queen’s majesty.”</p>

<p>He died, and was buried at Wilberton the 20th
of September, 1568.</p>

<p>He is chiefly memorable for his metrical prayer
intended to be sung in the church against the Pope
and the Turk, of whom he seems to have had the
most alarming apprehensions; and in consequence
of which he has been ridiculed by sir John Denham,
Corbet, Butler, and others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FAIRFORD_WINDOWS_1">FAIRFORD WINDOWS</h2>

</div>

<p>Are much admired, says the provincial historian
of Glocestershire, for their excellent painted glass.
There are twenty-eight large windows, which are
curiously painted with the stories of the Old and
New Testament: the middle windows in the choir,
and on the west side of the church, are larger
than the rest; those in the choir represent the
history of our Saviour’s Crucifixion; the window
at the west end represents Hell and Damnation;
those on the side of the church, and over the
body, represent the figures in length of the prophets,
apostles, fathers, martyrs and confessors,
and also the persecutors of the church. The painting
was designed by Albert Durer, an eminent
Italian Master: the colours are very lively, especially
in the drapery: some of the figures are so
well finished, that sir Anthony Vandyke affirmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
that the pencil could not exceed them. This curious
painting was preserved from zealous fury in
the great rebellion, by turning the glass upside
down.</p>

<p>John Tame, esq. founded this church in the
year 1493. He was a merchant, and took a prize-ship
bound for Rome, in which was this painted
glass: he brought both the glass and workmen into
England, built the church for the sake of the
glass, and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p class="right">Atkyns’s Hist. of Glocestershire,
p. 226. 1768. fol.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the tradition of the
famous Albert Durer having furnished the drawings
will not, as Mr. Dallaway justly observes,
bear the test of chronology; for he was not twenty
years of age when these windows were put up;
nor is it probable that he had then attained to
such proficiency—to say nothing of the time necessary
for the perfecting such works.</p>

<p class="center">(Mus. Ashm. No. 1153.)</p>

<p>Quam sit semper vobis facile, et pronum, justo
servire, sobriisque lachrimis obtemperare, ipsi
mihi vos dixistis modo, qui egregio oratori, et
invicto argumento fideliter cessistis, mihi tantum
post consumptum humorem, et historiæ, meæ
fidem vestram et suspiria præstituri. Si qua autem
unquam ageretur causa quæ suis viribus staret,
neque patrono aliquo, aut oratore indigeret, hæc
ipsa profecto hodierna est, quæ nec adversarium
infestum habet, nec facilem auditorem postulat;
hæc ipsa est, quæ in omni familia versata, vexata,
compressa, ad forum postea, et cœlum provocat,
humano generi se dat obviam, et una Britannia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
nunc orbem replet. Tam multa, variaque unius
mors est, ut ubique moriatur; tam frequens dolor
ut humanitatem omnem hac ipsa cogitatione imbuat.
Nescit enim domestica esse aut paucorum
fama, pervia simul et ambitiosa, utrumque simul
minatur polum, rumpetque mœnia aut transibit
caprificus: ideoque facti repetitione aliqua opus
est; ad metus vestros, et necessitates descendite,
affectus vestros interrogate, quis desiderii modus
aut finis. Dicite tandem utrum timere quicquid
possitis, aut amare sine Henrico, sitque ille miseriæ
vestræ vera causa, qui felicitati vestræ sola
spes emicuit—quare aures ego hodie vestras non
appello, sed oculos, neque auditores ut olim neque
censores alloquar, sed homines, sed Britannos.
Adeste igitur, Anglosissimi Academici, lassi, queruli,
mihique per hunc mensem a primo hujus
nuncio ruinæ, non tacito sed muto post lachrimas
jam deliberatas aspirate, et dolorem illum, quem
vel vita nostra vincere non possumus, data quasi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
opera dolendo leniamus. Exanimat enim possessorem
ægrum luctus longus, et prodigus mentem
sine sensu vulnerat, et quasi jam humanitas potius
aut natura, quæ morbus dici vellet, lachrimarum
suarum epulis impleri gaudet, et imperiosa consuetudine
satiatur. Quare redeat jam ad se oculus
unusquisque vestrûm, animamque in oculos
arripiat. Henricum cogitet sive principem sive
nostrum et vincet, credo ratio, aut suadebit
pietas, ut omnes hodie simus Heracliti sive enim
ad majorum sepulchra et imagines, proavosque
ejus multum remotissimos revertimur, honor est
et crescit acervus, nec sine centum regibus potest
prodire, si patremque matremque jam superstites,
quod sæpius proferre juvat jam superstites, jam
supra cyathum, et cultrum, pyram flammamque
jam superstites, et si quid votis nostris precibusque
jam litare possumus, sero superstaturos. Hos
si repetimus Deus est in utroque parente. Si cunabula
respicimus, et Lucinam ejus, quid in illa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
infantia non debuit esse plus quam mortale, quæ
a sponsoribus Belgiis et immortali Elizabetha
Christo initiata, et æternitati, pueritiam autem nullam
habuit, qui annum ... unum excessit ex
ephebis, et tanquam tempus præcipitare mallet,
quam expectare, annos non ætate sed virtute æstimat,
neque hominem se longævum esse sed virum
cupit. In omni actione, rebusque gestis se juvenem
præbuit, solum in affectu senem, et suos annos sic
explevit, ut nonagenarium esse illum vellet quis
libenter agnoscere. Senectutem pariter nec habuit
nec exoptavit, neque exhæreditavit eum morbus,
sed industriam, vitæque suum patrimonium reliquum
aut laboribus vendidit, aut studio decoxit.
Diuturnioris spem vitæ ei natura dederat, dare
melioris non poterat; indicium prorsus quod
illum cæca fortuna non vidisset maximum; mens
pariter condidisset optimum, adeone raro succumbit
tenuiori, et æternum elementum gloriæ
perituræ auræ infeliciter serviet? Adeone virtus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
qua vivimus minor erit vilissimo illius aeris haustu,
quo vivendum est. Atqui redeat in Chaos unde
prognatum est, ingratum illud aeris elementum, si
malis tantum indulgeat, invideat bonis, si inutili
populo spiret, principibus lateat, principibus huic.
Ecquis mihi vestrûm hanc Syntaxim imputat, illum
ut dicam principibus, qui et multus erat, virtutemque
in aliis fractam et remissam, totam sibi suisque
imperiis mancipasset; unaque sua anima effecit
præstantissima, ut si veteres philosophos
interrogamus, infinitum animarum exercitum in
hoc uno extitisse crederent? Sed consulite memoriæ
vestræ et officio, historiam revocate, narrate
Principem; quisquamne melior? quisquamne
major? Deo scilicet et cœlo stirpeque sua animoque
proximus: non tamen ideo humani oneris,
aut terreæ vicinitatis immemor, Deumque immortalem
quem metu subditissimo coluit, semper et
admiratus est; precibus imperatoriis, et quasi
libera servitute quotidie vincit; movet hortatu,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
docet Salomonis æmulus familiam sensu, populum
fama concitat, prælucet ipse omnibus pietate,
neque autoritate bonos sed exemplo facit. Irasci
aliquando, neque potuit, neque vellet, neque pœna
cujusque, sed pœnitentia contentus est, credo
itaque ut qui sine felle viveret, sine sanguine imperaret.
Neque amabilis magis, et mansuetus
quam domesticus et frugalis; servorum nomina,
studia, vitæque instituta cognovit, in domo sua
mensaque ipse paterfamilias, nimirum ut qui Œcumenicus
esse debuit, Œconomicus quandoque esse
posset. Studia sua et exercitia corporis, (quam
cœli et Decembris patientissimus erat) campestria
plerumque et in sole fuerunt.</p>

<p>Verum credo nihil horum est (Academici) orationis
meæ horribilius est non religionis. Egoque
cæsus olim pulvere Novembris, hodie cæcubio, hodie
insanio. Nos utinam vani: Totus igitur est
in apparatu Henricus noster quem quærimus, jamque
aut equo insidet, aut choræis hasta vel gladio
dominatur, ipse Hymenæus etiam et nuptias

nitentibus fratri Carolus et totus in illos. Invitant,
properant, parant Fredericus et Elizabetha,
et ver illud perpetuum et poeticum hac solum in
regione deprehenditur. Æstate prima Woodstochiam
suam cogitat Henricus, et vicinam academiam
adventu primo, scholaresque (quos vocat
suos) accersit, ut habeat convivas musas, et si
placuerit, convictores; juvat et meminisse potestis,
qualis ibi tum in scena prodierit, in qua ipse
erat pro triumpho, ipse pro spectaculo. Quotus
illa nocte adest Henricus?—Quotus princeps,
quam magnificus, quam innocens, cui vel esuriens
Jesuita potuit ignoscere. O dementiam suavem,
gratissimum errorem, et religiosum delirium, in vobis
redivivum Principem, Britanni, jubilate Henricum,
O beatum impostorem.</p>

<p>Qui istud nec audiunt, nec credunt malum, nos
miseros, qui in illa hostium multitudine et via fortunæ
viximus, et nescire dolorem non minus sit difficile,
quam cognitum extinguere. Quod si vox populi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
quæ aliquando Dei esse dicitur, eadem potuisset
de morte tua et fama decernere, caruisses hodie
lachrimis, et longo nostrorum funeri superfuisses.
In te enim non tam morientis fatum, quam pacis,
quam reipublicæ situm est; non peris sed destruis,
neque mors hæc dat, sed confusio; diluvium
est, nec caret prodigio. Oraculum est, nec sine
sacerdote aut pontifice potest intelligi. Quam
non mortalis eras Henricus, mortalis; adeone
nonus esse nunquam potes, et nullus esses, brevis
est quia bonus, minorque quia melior.</p>

<p>Nobis interim quod reliquum, quam ut festinetis
juvenes, animamque principis fugitivam, per
silentium et solitudinem sequamini: ut longitudinem
vitamque inimicis posthac exoptetis, sociisque
vestris, fratribusque suadeatis, quam sit senectus
post fatum principis vilis et ignominiosa. Nos interim
viri, qui in longiori ludibrio constituti sumus,
consulamus huic vitio, facinusque ætatis lachrimis
expiemus; et experiamur modo utrum anima principis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>

nine and ten, and ended at one; the name of it was Alba,
whereof I never saw reason; it was a pastoral, much like
one which I have seen in King’s College in Cambridge. In
the acting thereof they brought in five or six men almost
naked, which were much disliked by the queen and ladies,
and also many rustical songes and dances, which made it
very tedious, insomuch that if the chancellors of bothe

He was afterwards vicar of Thorncombe in Devonshire,

<p>“A discourse of the godly life and Christian death of
Mistriss Katharine Stubbs, who departed this life at Burton
on Trent, 14th of December,” (1592.) was written by her
brother, the sanctimonious author of “The Anatomie of
Abuses.”</p>

<p>Anne Askew, burned in 1546 for her rigid adherence
to her faith, wrote “a balade which she sang when she
was in Newgate;” printed by Bale. A long account of
her examination and subsequent martyrdom may be seen
in Foxe’s “Actes and Monuments,” vol. ii. p. 1284. edit.
1583. bl. let.</p>

<p>With the last I am less intimately acquainted; but I take
her to be the same “lady” of whom the favourite son of
Mrs. Merrythought sings, in the last act of “The Knight
of the Burning Pestle.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="label">[114]</a> It is almost superfluous to observe, that rosemary
was supposed by our forefathers to be very efficacious in
strengthening the retentive faculties; and, by being always
borne at funerals, was calculated to perpetuate the remembrance
of the deceased. “Here is a strange alteration:
for, the rosemary that was washt in sweet water to set out
the bridall, is now wet in teares to furnish her burial.”—Decker’s

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> Richard Greenham was educated at Pembroke-Hall in
Cambridge, and became minister of Dry-Drayton, three
miles distant; where it should seem, from a rhyming proverb,
that his success in the ministry was not proportionate
to his zeal:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Greenham had pastures green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But sheep full lean.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What,” says Fuller (Church Hist. lib. ix. 220.), “was
Dry-Drayton but a bushel to hide,—London an high
candlestick to hold up the brightness of his parts?” Thither
he repaired; and, after an ‘erratical and planetary life,’
settled himself at Christ-Church, where he ended his days
in 1592.</p>

<p>“His master-piece,” says Fuller, “was in comforting
wounded consciences.”—Quid multis!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> “Tous les tempéramens,” say our neighbours, “ne se
ressemblent pas.” The Divine thus satyrized by Corbet is
lauded by Fuller in high strains of eulogy. He was born
at Marston near Coventry, and was educated at Christ
College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of
M. A. Having obtained the living of St. Andrew’s
parish in that university, he resided there till his death.—“He
would pronounce the word <i>damme</i> with such an emphasis,”
says Fuller, (Holy State, p. 80. fol. 1652.) “as left
a doleful echo in his auditors’ ears a good while after.”
This passage is of itself a sufficient illustration of the poet.
His works were published in three volumes, folio, 1612.
The first in the collection is, “A Golden Chaine, containing
the Order of the Causes of Salvation and Damnation,
&amp;c., in the tables annexed.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
